# Awaken
Awaken is a Work In Progress, Moderation ( WIP ), Utility Bot, and the official Discord Bot of the [Jcord](https://discord-jcord/jcord/) Library.

## Installation
- Firstly, clone the repository. ( Optional, you can just donwload the direct zip )  
  - `$ git clone https://github.com/discord-jcord/Awaken.git`  

- Go to the path of the File.  
  - `$ cd path/To/Awaken/Folder`  

- Install the Dependencies  
  - `$ npm install`  
    - If it didn't work, `$ npm run installdeps`  

- Run the bot  
  - `$ node .` or `$ node index`  

## Configuration
- Edit the `config.js.example` file and replace the required elements to the one you desire.  

- Rename the `config.js.example` file to `config.js`  

- Lastly, run the bot.  
  - `$ node .` or `$ node index`  

## Making Changes
If you would check the `index.js` file, you would see that the code is obfuscated, meaning it will run but not readable. If you are willing to edit/contribute to it, kindly pm me on discord `Kevlar#0001` and agree with the License Statement i will give. Once agreed, i will send the deobfuscated file. Any illegal copy of the deobfuscated "software" or code will be punished.
I will post pictures in the `/licenseignore`, meaning that every user in that image contains a copy of the Deobfuscated code and can ignore the Following Conditions:  

- Disclose source  
- Same license  
- State Changes ( You can still state changes if you want )  

They can also Modify the code itself and re-upload it as their own, but will require credits from the Original Creators.
